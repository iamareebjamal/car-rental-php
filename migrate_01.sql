Yes, only four cylinders, but it sprints from zero to 60 in less than six seconds! Topping the range is a 5.0L V8 good for over 400 horsepower.

But is it a muscle car or is it a sports car? It has certainly got the brawn to launch it in a straight line (zero to 60 mph in a hair over six seconds, thanks to its big Hemi® engine), using its six-speed manual stickshift; the newer models’ independent suspension means the Challenger is a sportier handler than ever before.
